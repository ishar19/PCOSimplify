Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal disorder that affects over 10 million people. Public awareness of PCOS is necessary because over half of the people that have it, are unaware of it. We have developed this website to help people know about PCOS and manage it, if they have it. It has been designed with and for people with polycystic ovary syndrome, keeping in mind their every need.
